          A shopping cart, often referred to as an online shopping cart or
          e-commerce shopping cart, is a digital tool or software used on
          e-commerce websites to facilitate the process of purchasing products
          or services. It simulates the experience of a physical shopping cart
          in a brick-and-mortar store, allowing customers to select items they
          wish to buy and then proceed to checkout for payment.
